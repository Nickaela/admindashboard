For this project, I'll be using grid for creating the interface of an admin dashboard.

Credits to Pictogrammers - https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/ for the icons.

As you can see, the dashboard only looks fine on pc's full width. I will fix it once I get back to this project. For now, I'm glad I made the dashboard from html to css. One progress at a time.
